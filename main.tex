\textbf{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Music Information Retrieval is a small but growing field, and music genre classification is an important subsection of this field. With the rise of internet services like Pandora, Spotify, and other recommendation systems, the ability for a computer to tag and associate songs has become ever more pressing. Music genre classification is a challenging problem as many songs can be classified under multiple genres. Furthermore, a song is a complex audio wave that must be translated into a digital vector before being classified. This transformation process takes a continuous wave and condenses it down to a vector set, creating some information loss inherent in the problem. In this work, we focus on testing various classification methods, and various features for classifying 30 second music clips into their appropriate genres. This work builds on the work of Tzanetakis and Cook, who published a paper titled "Automatic Musical Genre Classification of Audio Signals," that focuses on the same gtzan dataset that is used in this project. We do a deeper analysis of different classifiers using a similar set of features, analyze the effects of including different features in the classification task, and dissect which genres lead to the highest classification confusion. Through our experiments, we discovered that Blues and Rock are the hardest for our classifiers to isolate from other genres, and thus we report results that both include Blues and Rock as well as exclude those two labels and data subsets. With Blues and Rock, the highest classification accuracy we were able to achieve was 70\%. Without the Blues and Rock data subset, we were able to achieve a 80\% accuracy.

\section{Our Work}
\subsection{Description of data and data processing}
The songs in our study are 30 second clips, and each song was provided as a set of frame-level features for each 20 millisecond frame in the song. ``Frame level features do not encode temporal variation, which is important for genre classification''[3] thus Fisher vectors and exemplars were used to aggregate temporal features into a per song feature vector. 
We performed manual feature selection by observing the discriminant strength of subsets of features on different classifiers; we found MFCC(Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients) to be the most discriminant feature for genre classification. Other features such as Chroma and Key Strength slightly improved overall accuracy.

\subsection{Classification Methods}
We used the following 9 different classifiers; eight are from the SciKitLearn Python Libraries and the Neural Net is from Matlab. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{K-nearest-neighbors(KNN)} 
    \item \textit{Logistic Regression with $l_2$ penalty(LR)} using one-vs-rest scheme 
    \item \textit{PCA followed by Logistic Regression (PCALR)}
    \item \textit{Random Forests Classifier}
    \item \textit{PCA followed by Random Forests classifier}
    \item \textit{Support Vector Machine (SVM)} with an exponential kernel function
    \item \textit{Naive Bayes classifier(NB)} using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm
    \item \textit{Decision Trees} 
    \item \textit{AdaBoost} with Random Forests as Weak Learners
    \item \textit{NNet Neural Network} from Matlab
\end{enumerate}
 
\subsection{Evalulation}
We performed stratified 10-fold cross-validation for each classifier. In this procedure, input is divided into 10 random equal size folds. The classifier is then trained on 9 of the folds and tested on a single fold. The accuracy of a classifier is average of the accuracy values achieved when each fold is used as a testing fold.
